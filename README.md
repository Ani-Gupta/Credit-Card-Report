# Credit Card Weekly Status Report - Power BI Project

## Project Overview

This Power BI project is designed to analyze and visualize the weekly status of credit card transactions and customer data. The data includes credit card details and customer demographics, which are processed to generate insights on various performance metrics.

The data source consists of two tables:

1. **Credit Card Table**: Contains detailed credit card transaction and usage information.
2. **Customer Table**: Contains customer demographic and financial information.

## Data Workflow

1. **Data Import**: The data is imported into MySQL from CSV files containing credit card and customer data.
2. **Power BI Connection**: Once the data is in MySQL, it is connected to Power BI Desktop for further analysis.
3. **Data Preparation**: The data is cleaned and transformed using DAX queries to create new columns and measures for efficient analysis.

## DAX Measures and Calculations

To facilitate in-depth analysis, several custom DAX queries and calculations have been created:

### 1. **Age Group**  
Categorizes customers into age groups.

```DAX
AgeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+",
    "unknown"
)
